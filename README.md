# Real-TimeLogProcessingPipeline


This project implements a real-time data pipeline for processing and analyzing logs using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Amazon S3, and Amazon Athena. The pipeline is designed to handle high-throughput log data, enabling efficient ingestion, transformation, and querying of large datasets.

Key Features
Data Ingestion: Logs are collected and streamed using Apache Kafka.
Stream Processing: Apache Spark processes the data in real time, performing transformations and aggregations.
Storage: Processed data is stored in Amazon S3 for scalable and cost-effective storage.
Analytics: Amazon Athena enables SQL-based querying and analysis of log data without the need for a dedicated database.
Scalability & Cloud Integration: The project is built on AWS and uses Confluent for Kafka management.
Technologies Used
Platform: AWS, Confluent
Technologies: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Amazon S3, Amazon Athena

 !!!!!! This project is scheduled to start within the next few days. Stay tuned for updates! !!!!!!!
