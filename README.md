# Real-TimeLogProcessingPipeline


This project implements a real-time data pipeline for processing and analyzing logs using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Docker. The pipeline is designed to handle high-throughput log data, enabling efficient ingestion, transformation, and querying of large datasets.

Key Features
Data Ingestion: Logs are collected and streamed using Apache Kafka.
Stream Processing: Apache Spark processes the data in real time, performing transformations and aggregations.
Storage: unknown (maybe noSQL one).
Analytics: unknown.
Technologies: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Docker, WSL

 !!!!!! This project is scheduled to start within the next few days. Stay tuned for updates! !!!!!!!
